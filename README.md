# Extend-A-Hand
## Description
A minecraft mod for 1.8.9 with the intent of extending the 'hand' of the player in building. So far, this mod mainly focuses on allowing for distant block placement, and the creation of lines from distant points to the player's position, simply pulling from the player's inventory. More building functionality is planned to come in future versions.

## Items
All extendos are able to select blocks in the world as their building resource by shift-clicking on them, and the building resource can be unselected by shift-clicking again on the same resource it has selected. If a resource is selected, the extendo will attempt to find that in your inventory and use it to build with, and if no resource is selected it will instead try to use whatever block your selection is touching. In creative mode, the extendos do not use inventory items up.
##### Handy Extendo
Allows for distant block creation.
##### Extended Extendo
Allows for line creation between selected point and player position. Useful for creating walls and floors quickly.

## Future Plans
Currently, all of these are just ideas with no specific order or timeframe. Some may be ready for release, some may be many versions later. I'm just noting them down so I don't forget any, and so you can get a rough idea of where the mod is headed in the future.
- Undo
- Item durability (limited use options)
- Config options (maximum distance, infinite durability, etc)
- Plane creation
- Lines/planes between two specified points (not player position)
- More Shapes (like spheres)
- Symmetry mode
- Block replace
- Distant mining
