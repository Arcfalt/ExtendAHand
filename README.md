# Extend-A-Hand
A minecraft mod with the intent of extending the 'hand' on the player in building. Scope is fairly limited, and mainly focuses on allowing for distant block placement, and creation of lines from distant points to the player. Currently no real downside, but in the future may have a cost (such as item durability) or something.
