# Extend-A-Hand
## Description
A minecraft mod for 1.9 with the intent of extending the 'hand' of the player in building. So far, this mod mainly focuses on allowing for distant block placement, and the creation of lines from distant points to the player's position, simply pulling from the player's inventory. More building functionality is planned to come in future versions.

## Items
All extendos are able to select blocks in the world as their building resource by shift-clicking on them, and the building resource can be unselected by shift-clicking again on the same resource it has selected. If a resource is selected, the extendo will attempt to find that in your inventory and use it to build with, and if no resource is selected it will instead try to use whatever block your selection is touching. In creative mode, the extendos do not use inventory items up.
##### Handy Extendo
Allows for distant block creation.
##### Extended Extendo
Allows for line creation between selected point and player position. Useful for creating walls and floors quickly.
##### Planar Extendo
Allows for hollow box creation between two selected points. Useful for quickly creating entire rooms. Simply select two points, then hold shift and click one of the selected points again to build the box.

## Configuration
Each type of extendo can be seperately configured with the following options in the mod config file.
- Maximum Amount of Blocks Built Per Use
- Maximum Distance Reachable
- Item Damage/Durability Toggle and Amount
- Item Cooldown Time
- Creative Only Toggle

Additionally, the planar tool can have a maximum single axis length set as well.

## Future Plans
Currently, all of these are just ideas with no specific order or timeframe. Some may be ready for release, some may be many versions later. I'm just noting them down so I don't forget any, and so you can get a rough idea of where the mod is headed in the future.
- Undo functionality
- Utilize Minecraft 1.9 dual wielding
- More Shapes (like spheres)
- In-game extendo customization
- Visual cooldown indication
- Symmetry mode
- Block replace
- Distant mining
