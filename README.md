# Extend-A-Hand
## Description
A minecraft mod for 1.8.9 with the intent of extending the 'hand' of the player in building. So far, this mod mainly focuses on allowing for distant block placement, and the creation of lines from distant points to the player's position, simply pulling from the player's inventory. More building functionality is planned to come in future versions.

## Items
##### Handy Extendo
This item allows for distant block creation.
##### Extended Extendo
Allows for line creation between selected point and player position. Useful for creating walls and floors quickly.

## Future Plans
Currently, all of these are just ideas with no specific order or timeframe. Some may be ready for release, some may be many versions later. I'm just noting them down so I don't forget any, and so you can get a rough idea of where the mod is headed in the future.
- Sneak-click blocks to pick building material
- Undo
- Item durability (limited use options)
- Config options (maximum distance, infinite durability, etc)
- Plane creation
- Lines/planes between two specified points (not player position)
- More Shapes (like spheres)
- Symmetry mode
- Block replace
- Distant mining
